## 🖼 How It Works

- **HTML Structure**

    - Inventory with `.item` cards for each avatar part.
    - Avatar preview with stacked `<img>` layers.
    - Dynamic price display below the preview.
- **CSS Styling**

    - Scrollable inventory grid on the left, fixed avatar preview on the right.
    - Light/dark themes using CSS variables and a `.dark` class.
- **JavaScript Behavior**

    - Click handlers update avatar layers.
    - Randomizer for each category.
    - Total coin calculation after each change.
    - Category filter buttons.
    - Theme toggle saved in `localStorage`.

## 🧩 Adding Items

Each item is a `.item` card:

```html
<div class="item eyes">
  <img class="item-img" src="path/to/image.png" />
  <span class="item-description">Name</span>
  <span class="item-xp">0</span>
  <span class="item-coins"><span class="coin-img"></span>125</span>
</div>
```

- The **category class** determines which avatar layer updates.
- The **coin value** is read from `.item-coins` for the price total.

## 🧪 Random Items

Include an item labeled **Random** in a category to let the click handler choose another random item from that category (skipping itself).

---

## 🛠 Customization

Edit CSS variables in `:root` for light mode and `body.dark` for dark mode.
